I recommend using PyO3 as it's a better maintained and feature complete project.

# RustyPy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iduartgomez/rustypy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iduartgomez/rustypy)
RustyPy is a code generator for generating binding functions between Rust and
Python files. In addition it provides a series of types for interfacing from
Python with Rust, with automatic type conversion handling for primitives and
other basic types (like vectors, hash maps and tuples) and an API for working
with those (both from Rust and Python).

## Features
- Generate bindings in Rust targetting Python functions.
- Generate bindings in Python targetting Rust functions.
- Provides types for interfacing between Rust and Python.

## Installation
To install RustyPy just use pip:
```
pip install rustypy
```
RustyPy requires Python 3.5 or more and works with Rust stable.

To target Python from Rust the package [cpython](https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython)
is required to initialize the package.

## Usage
RustyPy includes a command line interface to generate the code, which you can
embeed in your build chain if it's necessary.

### Generate Python bindings in Rust
You can execute the script writing:
```
$rustypy -h
```
or
```
$python -m rustypy -h
```
make sure that rustypy is in your current Python path. The help command has
all the information to generate bindings succesfully.

It also includes functions to generate bindings dynamically. In Python use:
```
from rustypy.pywrapper import bind_py_pckg_funcs
# default prefix is "rust_bind_"
optional = ["my_bind_prefix_", "other_prefix_"]
bind_py_pckg_funcs(prefixes=optional)
```
This function will generate the bindings for the package from which is
called from (so the package must be initiated placing an  \__init__.py file in
one of the parents folders).

### Generate Rust bindings in Python
Due to the nature of Python this is done dynamically, so no files
are generated and the bindings are wrapped appropriately with their own callables
from Python.

```
from rustypy.rswrapper import bind_rs_crate_funcs

source_path = "/home/user/workspace/rs_test_lib"
compiled_lib = "/home/user/workspace/rs_test_lib/target/debug/libtest_lib.so"

# default prefix is "python_bind_"
optional = ["my_bind_prefix_", "other_prefix_"]
lib_binds = bind_rs_crate_funcs(source_path, compiled_lib, prefixes=optional)

lib_binds.my_bind_prefix__ffi_function("Hello from Python!")
```

There is no concept of 'module' in C (which is the language used for interfacing)
so the functions cannot be namedspaced as you would in pure Rust. Read about
Rust FFI in [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ffi.html).
